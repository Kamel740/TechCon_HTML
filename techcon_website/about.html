            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>TechCon began in 2010 as a small meetup of local software developers in San Francisco. Over the years, it
                has grown into an internationally recognized conference, attracting innovators, engineers, and thought
                leaders from all over the world.

                From its early focus on open-source collaboration, TechCon has expanded to include AI, cybersecurity,
                quantum computing, and sustainability in tech. Each year builds on the last, creating a legacy of
                forward-thinking conversations and groundbreaking announcements.

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon’s mission is to empower the global tech community through knowledge-sharing, innovation, and
                inclusive dialogue.

                We believe that technology is not just about code — it's about solving real problems and improving
                lives.

                At its core, TechCon promotes open collaboration, diversity in tech, ethical development, and
                sustainable innovation. Our goal is to create a platform where developers, designers, researchers, and
                entrepreneurs come together to shape the future — responsibly and creatively.
